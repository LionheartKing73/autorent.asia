established European family business based in Bangkok, we have been booking
Thailand car rental for thousands of worldwide customers since 2006, so we have
been around a while now. We have noticed the trends in the business and we
believe that there is a place for a company like us, one that is dedicated to
providing a personal service but using modern technology: the internet. We
reach agreements with rental companies in each area where we offer car
rental.&nbsp; We do not ride on the back of someone else’s web site just taking
a commission and with no knowledge of where the cars come from or the
supplier’s service conditions.&nbsp; Our web site and the search engine are ours,
we have developed them and we update them daily. We believe we understand what
our customers want, a safe, reliable car with backup in case of an emergency
but not at any expense, money is hard to earn and we all want to enjoy it, not
give it away. We believe that you want to find that on an easy to read, clear
web site with transparent pricing, no hidden extras. The cars you see on the
web site should be the same or remarkably similar to the one that you book, so
if you book a Honda Accord, you want a Honda Accord, or a car of the same size,
try getting mum &amp; dad and 4 kids in a Honda Jazz……….and all their clothes
and their toys. You also want to know that your money is safe. Diamond Car
Rental help you safeguard your money by only asking you to pay the booking
deposit when you book your car, this guarantees your choice of car and you do
not pay that until you receive our invoice so that you know your choice of car
is available and that the price we have quoted is correct. To ensure that you
cannot lose your booking deposit we give you a free cancellation credit and we
use the services of PayPal, the world’s most secure on-line payment system to
collect our money for us. Why PayPal? Because PayPal keep your confidential
credit card details within their secure banking system, we never see sight of
those details, you can pay using the PayPal secure on-line system using your
credit card, you do not need a PayPal account. Your credit card issuer
guarantees your payment, did you know that if you pay using your credit card or
your PayPal account and the provider fails to provide or provides you with
goods or services that are not of the quality that they advertised, then your
credit card issuer or PayPal will refund your money. That’s why! Now why do we
only collect the booking deposit? Because if by some small chance the car
rental company supplying your car does go bust, then it will be inconvenient,
but we have not lost your money, we simply find you a car from a different
supplier, so how safe is that?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Now have fun finding the car of your choice and then book

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Visiting a Thailand beach
or island is the preferred holiday for hundreds of thousands of visitors to
Thailand every year. Thailand is blessed with natural beauty and its islands
are amongst the most scenic and beautiful in the world. Likewise, each Thai beach,
such as Karon Beach in Phuket, Chaweng Beach on Koh Samui, or picturesque Maya
Bay on Koh Phi Phi, is simply stunning, and many feature powdery sand, crystal
clear water, and postcard-perfect scenery. <br/>
<br/>
Each Thai beach and island has its own character and identity and therefore
draws a specific type of visitor.&nbsp; Each coastal area contains a slice of
heaven suitable for a different style of traveler:&nbsp; The west coast of
Thailand, along the Andaman Sea, features beaches that appeals to every type of
traveler, including the activity-filled resort island of Phuket; the popular
backpacker beaches of Koh Phi Phi, Koh Lanta, and Krabi; the family friendly,
laid back, and pristine coast of Khao Lak (the launching point for trips to the
spectacular Similan Islands); and the remote, undeveloped islands of the far
south.<br/>
<br/>
Along the Gulf coast, the resort island of Koh Samui lies nearby the natural
splendor of Koh Phangan and the scuba diving paradise of Koh Tao.&nbsp; Closer
to Bangkok are the popular resort town of Hua Hin, a favorite among Thais, and
its quieter neighbor Cha Am.&nbsp; Finally, to the east of Thailand, the
northern Gulf features Bangkok weekend getaway Koh Samet, and the up-and-coming
resort island of Koh Chang, which has both upscale resorts and budget beach
bungalows.<br/>
<br/>
Certain Thai beaches and islands, like Koh Tarutao National Park, offer limited
accommodation and facilities and draw more adventurous travelers who are
looking for a more 'back to basics' holiday experience. Others, such as Kamala
Beach in Phuket, offer world class facilities (accommodation, restaurants,
nightlife, etc) to entice visitors with bigger budgets who require creature
comforts. It is important to note that this diversity exists not only between
the islands, but between different beaches as well. Whereas one Thai beach
might offer raucous entertainment, another a few kilometers away on the same
island might only draw those looking for a quiet holiday. <br/>
<br/>
Phuket, Thailand's largest island, is a perfect example of this contrast.&nbsp;
Phuket is certainly the most developed Thai island, having been the first Thai
beach resort destination.&nbsp; Located on the Andaman coast, Phuket contains
numerous beaches, including the activity filled Patong beach, with its exciting
nightlife, and the more family friendly Karon and Kata beaches.&nbsp; Across
the island are luxurious five-star resorts and a wealth of Thai spas that serve
to pamper visitors on any budget.&nbsp; In addition to a lush, tropical
interior that features a variety of exotic wildlife, Phuket is an ideal
location for day trips to nearby islands, such as Koh Phi Phi, a favorite
destination for scuba divers, and Phang Nga bay, where visitors can snorkel,
kayak, and visit iconic James Bond Island (Koh Tapu).&nbsp; Phuket is easily
accessible via its international airport that connects domestically with
Bangkok, Koh Samui, and Chiang Mai.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Koh Samui is the prime island attraction in the Gulf of Thailand.&nbsp; The
most popular beach, Chaweng, features accommodation from five-star luxury
resorts to affordable beach bungalows, and dining includes fine dining on
international cuisine and casual beachside seafood barbeques.&nbsp; Samui is
both family friendly and budget oriented with a host of activities, some of
Thailand's finest spas, and is conveniently located nearby some of Thailand's
finest diving off neighboring Koh Tao.&nbsp; Samui International Airport
connects domestically to Bangkok, Krabi, Phuket, and Chiang Mai. <br/>
<br/>
Krabi is a province on the mainland Andaman coast, near Phuket.&nbsp; In
addition to popular beachside resort areas, such as Railey Beach, Krabi
includes a number of spectacular islands, such as the Phi Phi Islands and Koh
Lanta, off of which some of Thailand's most popular scuba diving sites are
found.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Every region of Thailand
be it in the north, south, central or northeast, has revealed a long legacy of
civilization. Evidence of this rich cultural heritage can still be seen today. </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>The two most prominent
'must-see' historical sites in Thailand are Sukhothai Historical Park and
Ayutthaya Historical Park. Both places are designated as world heritage sites
and both attract millions of admirers annually, who come to see the evidence of
Siam's former glory. </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Sukhothai and Ayutthaya
are considered the two most significant ancient kingdoms in Thai history, since
Siam was united as a nation some 750 years ago. Both kingdoms had
well-structured Buddhist communities, with advanced artistic and cultural
development.</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>In Sukhothai, visitors
can see well-restored ruins of the royal palaces, Buddhist temples, the city
gates, walls, moats, dams, ditches, ponds, canals and the water dyke control
system, which represented the magical and spiritual center of the kingdom.</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>For travelers with more
limited time who don't want to travel too far from Bangkok, the Ayutthaya
Historical Park is a perfect choice. Just 76 km north of Bangkok, this site
reveals the glory of the Ayutthaya Empire, which held sway in the region for
more than 400 years. The Ayutthaya historical park contains the ruins of
ancient Buddhist temples and royal palaces in a well-organized city structure. </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Ayutthaya was the capital
of Thailand from 1350 until it was ruthlessly sacked by the Burmese in 1767.
Although a shadow of its former glory, the magnificent ruins of the old city
can still be admired. Attractions include the ruins of the former Royal Palace
and many ancient temples, which form a complex spread over the vast area of the
historical park. </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Before or after touring
Ayutthaya Historical Park, don't forget to visit Bangkok's own historical
center. The city's Rattanakosin Island is rich in historical sites from the
early Bangkok period. Here, you can get a glimpse of how Ayutthaya might have
looked. At the time of constructing Bangkok, the goal of the architects was to
continue the cultural heritage of Ayutthaya. The art and architecture of the
temples and palaces therefore followed the style of Ayutthaya quite closely.
The most obvious indications of this can be seen in the Golden Mount at Wat
Saket, the Grand Place, the royal temples and Wat Arun, which imitated the
artistic designs of Ayutthaya. </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Today, if you look at
Rattanakosin, the original island of Bangkok, you will see a city tucked into a
bend in the river in the same way that Ayutthaya was. Its principal structures
are also aligned in similar fashion. </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Apart from the historical
remains of the true Thai kingdoms, you can see the historical arts of the Khmer
empire, which ruled over the region during the 10th to the 14th centuries AD. </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Anyone familiar with the
magnificent Angkor Wat in Cambodia's Siem Riep may be surprised to learn that
the Khmer empire once embraced the area of modern-day Thailand as well.
Historic artifacts of the Khmer civilization have been found mainly in the
lower part of the northeastern region of Thailand. </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Major Khmer complexes include
the Phimai Sandstone Sanctuary in Nakhon Ratchasima, Phanom Rung and Muang Tham
Sanctuary in Buriram and Khao Phra Viharn Sanctuary in Sisaket province. </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Like Angkor Wat itself,
these temples were all originally constructed as Hindu temples dedicated to
Vishnu and Shiva. It was under Jayavaraman VI that Buddhism replaced Hinduism
and thus the Hindu temples were converted to 'wat'. </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Their significance to
Thai Buddhists remained strong even with the decline of the Khmer empire. The
Khmer style heavily influenced the styles of the later Sukhothai and Ayutthaya
periods, most apparent in the architectural style of the Prang in Buddhist
temples.</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Phanom Rung Historical
Park in Buriram province is probably the most impressive Khmer complex in
Thailand. After 17 years of restoration, the temple complex is the best
restored of all the Khmer monuments in Thailand. The beauty of the main prang
of Phanom Rung lies not only in its plan but in the vibrant stone carvings
which cover large parts of the temple. Many lintels and pediments depict
episodes from Indian texts such as the Ramayana. </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>In Nakhon Ratchasima,
Phimai sandstone sanctuary has been magnificently restored and renovated and
has been preserved as a national historical park. Built in the shape of a
rectangle, 665 meters wide and 1,030 meter long, it is the largest sandstone
sanctuary in Thailand. </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Khmer influence can be
seen as far away as Lopburi and Kanchanaburi. Evidence can be seen in the
Khmer-style Phra Prang Sam Yot in the central city of Lopburi and the remains
of the Prasat Muang Singh in Kanchanaburi, major attractions in their
respective provinces.</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;Evidence found at
several archeological sites in Kanchanaburi indicates that the area has been
inhabited since the prehistoric era. In more recent times, the province has
acted as a buffer zone to hinder invasions from Burma, Thailand's long-time
rival to the west.</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Undoubtedly, Kanchanaburi
is best known for its role in the Second World War. Chosen by the Japanese as
the main supply route for an invasion westwards into British India,
Kanchanaburi was the scene of untold suffering and atrocities during the
construction of the notorious 'Death Railway'. The province still has many
sites to tell the story of the Japanese war machine and the countless Asians and
prisoners of war who perished because of it.</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Phetchaburi is the place
where the golden era of Ayutthaya lives on. Much visited by the Chakri monarchs
at the turn of the last century, the province offers the visitor a wealth of
historic temple sites and magnificent royal palaces.</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>With its rich and
fascinating history, Chiang Mai province has a large number of memorable
historical sites to intrigue and enthrall even the most demanding of visitors.
There are numerous Thai temples or 'wats' (over 300 in the provincial capital
alone) dating from as far back as the 13th century. There are also many other
interesting sites such as museums, palaces, ancient cities, archaeological
sites, statues and monuments to be viewed.</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>For centuries, Northern
Thailand has been the subject of numerous wars between Thailand and Burma, and
the diverse culture of the region is evident of this fact. </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>In no aspect is this more
reflected than in the religious architecture of the region, and many of the
historical sites in Mae Hong Son are no exception to this rule. </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Most of the important
temples, such as Wat Phra That Doi Kong Mu, Wat Hua Wiang, Wat Chong Klang and
Chong Kham, have striking, white pagodas, a trait distinctively Burmese, and
many of Mae Hong Son's enshrined Buddha statues are dissimilar from those found
in other regions of the country.</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>This Northeastern
province is an ideal destination for the history lover, as it offers some of
the finest Khmer artifacts found outside of Cambodia. Several museums in Khon
Kaen house fine collections Khmer art, and the ruins of numerous ancient Khmer
temples can be found in the countryside.</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

to explore the wonders of nature, a Thailand National Park is an outstanding
destination. There are many forest parks if you long to explore the tropical
rainforest or travel deep into the wild jungle to see some of the exotic
animals in Thailand. If you prefer scuba diving, snorkeling, or sea kayaking
there are a number of national marine parks in the south and east of Thailand
that are simply stunning. <br/>
<br/>
In fact, Thailand has over 100 national parks, including more than 20 marine
parks; each park in Thailand contains unique flora and fauna as well as basic
amenities, including some bungalows with electricity and grounds for camping
(even if you don't bring your own tent.) Most of these parks are easily
accessible and admission fees are relatively modest, though booking ahead is
often recommended as some parks are very popular with Thai visitors, particular
over long holiday weekends.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Eco-oriented activities at a national park in Thailand range from trekking,
kayaking, nature photography, camping and snorkeling to spotting exotic birds
and other animals in Thailand unlike those found elsewhere in the world.&nbsp;
However, simply relaxing and enjoying the pristine beauty of unspoiled Thai
nature may be the most rewarding experience of all.<br/>
<br/>
A few of Thailand's more popular national parks are: <br/>
<br/>
Khao Yai National Park is perhaps the most popular Thai park as it is just 200
km from Bangkok and the bucolic surrounding area features a variety of
accommodation options, a variety of activities, and diverse wildlife that
includes wild tigers, elephants, bears, and exotic birds, such as the giant
hornbill. </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

Park in Northern Thailand features Thailand's highest peak and contains
waterfalls and forests containing numerous species of orchid.&nbsp; The area is
also inhabited by indigenous hill tribe villagers. </span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>Sam Roi Yot National Park
is a favorite for bird watchers as the coastal region of the park features
marshes that are home to a variety of waterfowl and other marine life. </span></p>

</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

Samet (conveniently located near Bangkok), Ang Thong Marine National Park (a
