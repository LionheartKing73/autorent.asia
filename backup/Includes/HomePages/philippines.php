lang=EN-US style='color:red'>GET THE OVERALL COST BEFORE YOU BOOK: </span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black'>it is becoming standard practice for car rental
companies to charge for extra or mandatory items. To check the prices for these
items you should open the: <b>Pricing</b> <b>Details</b> box. We have listed
all of the insurance details, mandatory charges &amp; extras and the costs of
those items for each car in that section. <b>THEY ARE NOT THE SAME FOR EVERY
CAR. </b>We recommend that you select your choice of car and then use the
pricing details box to gain the overall cost, the headline cost as shown in the
car overview is not always the cheapest. </span></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none'><b><span
lang=EN-US style='color:red'>SO WHO IS DIAMOND CAR RENTAL?</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black'> Well, we are an established European family
business based in Bangkok, we have been booking Thailand car rental for
thousands of worldwide customers since 2006, so we have been around a while
now. We have noticed the trends in the business and we believe that there is a
place for a company like us, one that is dedicated to providing a personal
service but using modern technology: the internet. We reach agreements with
rental companies in each area where we offer car rental.&nbsp; We do not ride
on the back of someone else’s web site just taking a commission and with no
knowledge of where the cars come from or the supplier’s service
conditions.&nbsp; Our web site and the search engine are ours, we have
developed them and we update them daily. We believe we understand what our
customers want, a safe, reliable car with backup in case of an emergency but
not at any expense, money is hard to earn and we all want to enjoy it, not give
it away. We believe that you want to find that on an easy to read, clear web
site with transparent pricing, no hidden extras. The cars you see on the web site
should be the same or remarkably similar to the one that you book, so if you
book a Honda Accord, you want a Honda Accord, or a car of the same size, try
getting mum &amp; dad and 4 kids in a Honda Jazz……….and all their clothes and
their toys. You also want to know that your money is safe. Diamond Car Rental
help you safeguard your money by only asking you to pay the booking deposit
when you book your car, this guarantees your choice of car and you do not pay
that until you receive our invoice so that you know your choice of car is
available and that the price we have quoted is correct. To ensure that you
cannot lose your booking deposit we give you a free cancellation credit and we
use the services of PayPal, the world’s most secure on-line payment system to
collect our money for us. Why PayPal? Because PayPal keep your confidential
credit card details within their secure banking system, we never see sight of
those details, you can pay using the PayPal secure on-line system using your
credit card, you do not need a PayPal account. Your credit card issuer
guarantees your payment, did you know that if you pay using your credit card or
your PayPal account and the provider fails to provide or provides you with
goods or services that are not of the quality that they advertised, then your
credit card issuer or PayPal will refund your money. That’s why! Now why do we
only collect the booking deposit? Because if by some small chance the car
rental company supplying your car does go bust, then it will be inconvenient,
but we have not lost your money, we simply find you a car from a different
supplier, so how safe is that?&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none'><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black'>Now have fun finding the car of your choice and
then book on-line and we will confirm your booking and ask you to pay your
booking deposit as quickly as we can. The most important asset in our business
is our customer; we look forward to serving you.&nbsp; </span></p>
