TIPS FOR CAR RENTERS IN NEW ZEALAND.</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><b><span style='color:red'>GET THE OVERALL COST BEFORE YOU BOOK: </span></b>it is becoming
standard practice for car rental companies to charge for extra or mandatory
items. To check the prices for these items you should open the: <b>Pricing</b> <b>Details</b>
box. We have listed all of the insurance details, mandatory charges &amp;
extras and the costs of those items for each car in that section. <b>THEY ARE
NOT THE SAME FOR EVERY CAR. </b>We recommend that you select your choice of car
and then use the pricing details box to gain the overall cost, the headline
cost as shown in the car overview is not always the cheapest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><b><span style='color:red'>CAR DESCRIPTION TERMS:</span></b> as the global car companies
merge and reduce the choice for the consumer so the prices increase. In many
countries, as well as offering cars from the global companies, we now have a
number of large scale localized operators who use slightly older but well
maintained cars; these cars are still fully insured and have roadside
assistance included in the price.

<ul  style='color:black'>
<li><u>5* NEW &amp; nearly NEW cars</u>: these cars are typically aged between new &amp; 4 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </li>  
<li><u>COST CUTTER PRE-USED cars:</u> are the best of the newer cars that have been rented before and are typically aged between 4 &amp; 8 years. Cleaned regularly and well maintained they are an excellent way to have a rental without the expense
of driving a nearly new  </li>  
car.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<li><u>CHEAP CHARLIES older cars: </u>nearly all rental companies use Japanese or European cars which have proven reliability, many of these cars are still in excellent condition after 8 years of rental work, after all they are cleaned
often and it is in the rental companies interest to maintain them to a high degree, those are your CHEAP CHARLIES, old &amp; reliable, just like
your????????????&nbsp; </li>

<p class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><b><span style='color:red'>SO WHO IS DIAMOND CAR RENTAL?</span></b> Well, we are an
established European family business based in Bangkok, we have been booking
Thailand car rental for thousands of worldwide customers since 2006, so we have
been around a while now. We have noticed the trends in the business and we
believe that there is a place for a company like us, one that is dedicated to
providing a personal service but using modern technology: the internet. We
reach agreements with rental companies in each area where we offer car rental. &nbsp;We
do not ride on the back of someone else’s web site just taking a commission and
with no knowledge of where the cars come from or the supplier’s service
conditions.&nbsp; Our web site and the search engine are ours, we have
developed them and we update them daily. We believe we understand what our
customers want, a safe, reliable car with backup in case of an emergency but
not at any expense, money is hard to earn and we all want to enjoy it, not give
it away. We believe that you want to find that on an easy to read, clear web
site with transparent pricing, no hidden extras. The cars you see on the web
site should be the same or remarkably similar to the one that you book, so if
you book a Honda Accord, you want a Honda Accord, or a car of the same size,
try getting mum &amp; dad and 4 kids in a Honda Jazz……….and all their clothes
and their toys. You also want to know that your money is safe. Diamond Car
Rental help you safeguard your money by only asking you to pay the booking
deposit when you book your car, this guarantees your choice of car and you do
not pay that until you receive our invoice so that you know your choice of car
is available and that the price we have quoted is correct. To ensure that you
cannot lose your booking deposit we give you a free cancellation credit and we
use the services of PayPal, the world’s most secure on-line payment system to
collect our money for us. Why PayPal? Because PayPal keep your confidential
credit card details within their secure banking system, we never see sight of
those details, you can pay using the PayPal secure on-line system using your
credit card, you do not need a PayPal account. Your credit card issuer
guarantees your payment, did you know that if you pay using your credit card or
your PayPal account and the provider fails to provide or provides you with
goods or services that are not of the quality that they advertised, then your
credit card issuer or PayPal will refund your money. That’s why! Now why do we
only collect the booking deposit? Because if by some small chance the car
rental company supplying your car does go bust, then it will be inconvenient,
but we have not lost your money, we simply find you a car from a different
supplier, so how safe is that?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='color:black'>Now have fun finding the car of your choice and then book
on-line and we will confirm your booking and ask you to pay your booking
deposit as quickly as we can. The most important asset in our business is our
customer; we look forward to serving you.&nbsp; </p>

style='color:black'>One of Wellington's most famous attractions is the little
red cable car that clanks up the steep slope from Lambton Quay to Kelburn. At
the top are a cafe, the Wellington Botanic Gardens, an observatory and the
small-but-nifty Cable Car Museum, which tells the cable car's story since it
was built in 1902 to open up hilly Kelburn for development. Take the cable car
back down the hill, or ramble down through the Botanic Gardens (a 30- to
60-minute walk, depending on your wend).</span></p>

Pelorus Sound on a genuine NZ Post delivery run. Bookings essential; BYO lunch.
Picton pick-up and drop-off available.</span></p>

normal;text-autospace:none'><b><span style='color:red'>Tamaki Maori Village: </span></b><span
style='color:black'>Maori culture is a major drawcard in Rotorua and, although
some find it heavily commercialised, it's a great opportunity to learn more
about the indigenous culture of NZ. The two big activities are concerts and <i>hangi</i>
meals, often packaged together in an evening's entertainment that features the
famous <i>hongi</i>, <i>haka</i>, and <i>poi</i> dances.</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>An established favourite
is Tamaki Maori Village, which does an excellent twilight tour to a <i>marae</i>
(meeting house) and Maori village 15km south of Rotorua. Buses collect from the
Hinemaru St booking office and also from most accommodation, and feature a
briefing on <i>marae</i> protocol by a Maori 'entertainer' (aka hilarious bus
driver). The concert is followed by a meat-heavy <i>hangi</i>.</span></p>

Rafting:&nbsp; </span></b><span style='color:black'>The Tongariro River has
some superb Grade III rapids for river rafting, as well as Grade I stretches

Rafting can start you off with a three-hour trip on Grade II Tongariro rapids
