<p><b><i><span
 style='color:red'>HANDY TIPS FOR CAR RENTERS IN MALAYSIA</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span
 >GET THE OVERALL COST BEFORE YOU BOOK: </span></b><span
 >it is becoming standard practice for car rental
companies to charge for extra or mandatory items. To check the prices for these
items you should open the: <b>Pricing</b> <b>Details</b> box. We have listed
all of the insurance details, mandatory charges &amp; extras and the costs of
those items for each car in that section. <b>THEY ARE NOT THE SAME FOR EVERY
CAR. </b>We recommend that you select your choice of car and then use the
pricing details box to gain the overall cost, the headline cost as shown in the
car overview is not always the cheapest. </span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:red'
 >CURRENCY</span></b><span 
>: Our car rental partners in Malaysia use MR (Malaysian
Ringgits) as their currency. They will charge your credit card, either Visa or
MasterCard or Amex in MR.&nbsp;Debit cards, cash, traveler’s cheques, e cheques
etc., are not usually accepted. Due to cross border currency controls PayPal
are unable to collect your booking deposit in Malaysian Ringgits, we will
instead collect the booking deposit in the Thai Baht equivalant.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:red'
 >DRIVING LICENCE</span></b><span 
>: To drive in Malaysia you must hold a current driving
licence from your country of residence, the text should be in English
characters and it should include an embedded photograph of yourself. If your
driving licence is not like this then we recommend that you obtain an
international licence. Drivers must be over 21 years of age. </span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:red'
 >INSURANCE COVERAGE:&nbsp; </span></b><span
 >all of our prices include full self drive
insurance and standard loss damage waiver. Standard loss damage waiver means
that your damage excess liability is reduced to a lower figure. Super loss
damage waiver insurance is available and reduces your damage excess liability
still further. Premium loss damage waiver is also available for many cars and
reduces your damage excess liability to ZERO. To view the damage excess
liabilities and to see cost for adding either Super or Premium loss damage
waiver, open the pricing details box. Damage excess liabilities and the cost of
Super or Premium loss damage waiver are not the same for every car; you should
check the prices for the car of your choice. </span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:red'
 >SECURITY DEPOSITS: </span></b><span 
>are required in most cases, after all the rental company
have probably never met you before and you are driving away in an expensive
piece of property. Security deposits are usually blocked against a credit card
which is done when you collect the car and the block is released when you
return the car. Security deposits can be reduced if you purchase additional
insurance cover or loss damage waiver. To view the amount of the security
deposits open the pricing details box. The security deposits are not the same
for every car; you should check the cost for the car of your choice.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:red'
 >ADDITIONAL DRIVERS:</span></b><span 
>&nbsp; are accepted by all of our Malaysian partners, to
view the cost for adding more drivers open the pricing details box. Additional
driver costs are not the same for every car; you should check the prices for
the car of your choice. </span></p>

 > for children from 6 months up are available as
an extra, to view the cost for child seats open the pricing details box. Child
seat costs are not the same for every car; you should check the prices for the

<p><b><span style='color:red'
 >SO WHO IS DIAMOND CAR RENTAL?</span></b><span
 > Well, we are an established European family
business based in Bangkok, we have been booking Thailand car rental for
thousands of worldwide customers since 2006, so we have been around a while
now. We have noticed the trends in the business and we believe that there is a
place for a company like us, one that is dedicated to providing a personal
service but using modern technology: the internet. We reach agreements with
rental companies in each area where we offer car rental.&nbsp; We do not ride
on the back of someone else’s web site just taking a commission and with ano
knowledge of where the cars come from or the supplier’s service
conditions.&nbsp; Our web site and the search engine are ours, we have
developed them and we update them daily. We believe we understand what our
customers want, a safe, reliable car with backup in case of an emergency but
not at any expense, money is hard to earn and we all want to enjoy it, not give
it away. We believe that you want to find that on an easy to read, clear web
site with transparent pricing, no hidden extras. The cars you see on the web
site should be the same or remarkably similar to the one that you book, so if
you book a Honda Accord, you want a Honda Accord, or a car of the same size,
try getting mum &amp; dad and 4 kids in a Honda Jazz……….and all their clothes
and their toys. You also want to know that your money is safe. Diamond Car
Rental help you safeguard your money by only asking you to pay the booking
deposit when you book your car, this guarantees your choice of car and you do
not pay that until you receive our invoice so that you know your choice of car
is available and that the price we have quoted is correct. To ensure that you
cannot lose your booking deposit we give you a free cancellation credit and we
use the services of PayPal, the world’s most secure on-line payment system to
collect our money for us. Why PayPal? Because PayPal keep your confidential
credit card details within their secure banking system, we never see sight of
those details, you can pay using the PayPal secure on-line system using your
credit card, you do not need a PayPal account. Your credit card issuer
guarantees your payment, did you know that if you pay using your credit card or
your PayPal account and the provider fails to provide or provides you with
goods or services that are not of the quality that they advertised, then your
credit card issuer or PayPal will refund your money. That’s why! Now why do we
only collect the booking deposit? Because if by some small chance the car
rental company supplying your car does go bust, then it will be inconvenient,
but we have not lost your money, we simply find you a car from a different
supplier, so how safe is that?&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span
 >Now have fun finding the car of your choice and
then book on-line and we will confirm your booking and ask you to pay your
booking deposit as quickly as we can. The most important asset in our business
is our customer; we look forward to serving you.&nbsp; </span></p>
